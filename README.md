# Database_Design

## December 2023 Assignment - GitHub Repo:
### Link to your online GitHub repo containing the following:

.ipynb notebook containing the following :

Markdown cells explaining the process used within your script we built in class (or a database you created for own use) and subsequent SQL code cells, for both: 
-  the DDL (table builds) - 5pts for the MDL and 5pts for the SQL Code itself and
-  the Data Loading Scripts - 5pts for the MDL and 5pts for the SQL Code itself

Using draw.io create a diagram of the datamart and include it on your GitHub repository along with the .ipynb(s) as shown above (10 pts)

### OK, here we go!
I am using Google Colab to create this .ipynb, because I though Jupiter Notebook needs to be purchased, than I started to research more about it, cause they said it is open source, hence free, but it got even more complicated with some random namedroping of conda, pip and what not, and that was that for me.

Also, I ran SQL code in The Azure Data Studio, because when I tried to run it in the Github I got ### SyntaxError: [invalid syntax](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rgjSfylCj5FiNVAIA0Aiag2XnTjwIe3C#scrollTo=DlyFgU63vBLm&line=14&uniqifier=1)
and they suggested I search stack overflow 

I did not do that, but I learned that in GitHub when you make a change you need NOT TO FORGET to press green button <Commit Changes>
