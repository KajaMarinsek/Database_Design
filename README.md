# Database_Design

## December 2023 Assignment - GitHub Repo:
**Link to your online GitHub repo containing the following:**

.ipynb notebook containing the following :

Markdown cells explaining the process used within your script we built in class (or a database you created for own use) and subsequent SQL code cells, for both: 
-  the DDL (table builds) - 5pts for the MDL and 5pts for the SQL Code itself and
-  the Data Loading Scripts - 5pts for the MDL and 5pts for the SQL Code itself

Using draw.io create a diagram of the datamart and include it on your GitHub repository along with the .ipynb(s) as shown above (10 pts)

### OK, here we go!
I am using Google Colab to create this .ipynb, because I though Jupiter Notebook needs to be purchased. Then I read it is an open source, hence free, so I started to research more about it but after it got even more complicated, with some random namedroping of conda, pip and what not, and that was that for me.

Also, I ran SQL code in The Azure Data Studio, because when I tried to run it in the Colab I got ### SyntaxError: [invalid syntax](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rgjSfylCj5FiNVAIA0Aiag2XnTjwIe3C#scrollTo=DlyFgU63vBLm&line=14&uniqifier=1)
and they suggested I search stack overflow :weary:

I did not do that, but I learned :nerd_face: that in GitHub when you make a change you need **_NOT TO FORGET_** to press the `button in green`   <code style="green : name_color">CommitChanges...</code>
